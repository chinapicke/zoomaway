  ## Description
  First project since graduating from bootcamp. I create a car rental website, following the websites such as Hertz and Avis. The user is able to view what cars are    available to be rented and recieve an email with their enquiry using EmailJS. This is also the first time I have used tailwind css. This website was created using React, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Tailwind CSS and EmailJS.

  Page has been deployed using Netlify.
